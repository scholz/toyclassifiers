# toyclassifiers

## Motivation
Provide simple, unoptimized implementations of common classification algorithms
to foster comprehensive understanding of the algorithms including
practical (implementation) details and optimization possiblities.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Installation of scikit learn for running test script

## Current status of implementations
* Naive Bayes
  * currently only continuous input variables are supported

* Decision Tree
  * uses CART algorithm for building tree
  * uses only entropy as scoring function
