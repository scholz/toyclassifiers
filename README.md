# toyclassifiers

## Motivation
Provide simple, unoptimized implementations of common classification algorithms
to foster comprehensive understanding of the algorithms including
practical (implementation) details and optimization possiblities.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Installation of scikit learn for running test script

## Implementation Status
* Naive Bayes
  * only supporting continuous input variables

* Decision Tree
  * uses only entropy as scoring function 

* K-Means
  * uses euclidean squared distance
  * uses random initalization or provided coordinates for centroids
